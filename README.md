# nomiepy
A minimal python library for accessing Nomie data stored in CouchDB.

To start simply get a CSV export from inside the app, and then run the get_trackers.py file against it. You now have the names for the trackers.

Now simple import the library and initiate it with the full URL for your CouchDB.
